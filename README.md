    (function (uniqueId) {
      window.PollWidget = window.PollWidget || {};
      var PollWidget = window.PollWidget;
      PollWidget[uniqueId] = PollWidget[uniqueId] || function (config) {
        (PollWidget[uniqueId].c = PollWidget[uniqueId].c || []).push(config);
      };
    })("_pw"); // ðŸ‘ˆ "_pw" is the unique identifier for the poll configuration (unique id is given by the user)
    // #endregion

    // #region: Attaching Configuration to the `window.PollWidget` object
    PollWidget._pw({
        parentElementId?: "id of the element inside which widget should be rendered. If not passed, container with unique id ('_pw' in this case) is created and is attached to the document.body",
        id: "config id",
        createdTimestamp: timestamp,
        question: "Question text",
        options: [
          {
            id: "Option id",
            label: "Option label",
            voteCount: 0,
          },
          ...
        ],
        totalVotes: 0, // total votes of this poll
      });
    // #endregion
  </script>
```
- In `main.tsx` file, config is taken from the `window.PollWidget` and it is:
  - Validated *(if the poll is not properly configured or same poll is configured twice, an Error is thrown)*,
  - Container for the Poll Widget is created based on the uniqueId mentioned by the user (example: `_pw`) while attaching config in the `window` object. *(if parentId is not passed)*,
  - Passed to the Widget component to render on the screen.
